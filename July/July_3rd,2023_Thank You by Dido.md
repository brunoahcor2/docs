### english:

    My tea’s gone cold, I’m wondering why
    I got out of 'better' at all
    The morning rain clouds up my 'window'
    and I can’t see at all
    And even if I could it’d all be grey,
    but your 'picture' on my wall
    It reminds me that it’s not so bad,
    it’s not so bad

    I drank too much last night, got bills to pay,
    my head just feels in pain
    I missed the bus and there’ll be hell today,
    I’m late for work again
    And even if I’m there, they’ll all imply
    that I might not last the day
    And then you call me and it’s not so bad,
    it’s not so bad and

    I want to thank you
    for giving me the best day of my life
    Oh just to be with you
    is having the best day of my life
    Push the 'door' , I’m home at last
    and I’m soaking through and through
    Then you hand me a town and all I see is you
    And even if my 'falls' down now,
    I wouldn’t have a clue
    Because you’re near me and
    I want to thank you
    for giving me the best day of my life
    Oh just to be with you
    is having the best day of my life

    Meu cha esta frio, eu estou me perguntando porque
